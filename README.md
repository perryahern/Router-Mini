### Steps for implementing React Router

* You'll notice we've already installed react-router-dom for you.
* Step 1: `import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';` inside your `index.js` file.
* Step 2: Wrap your `<App />` component that you're passing to `ReactDOM.render()` with your `<Router> </Router>` component.
* Step 3: open up your chrome `REACT DEV TOOLS` and notice your app is now all wrapped in `BrowserRouter`
* Step 4: inside the `REACT DEV TOOLS` expand `<BrowserRouter>` and highlight `<Router>` and notice that here is a `"history"` object on props.

### Steps for "Declaring" your routes

* Step 5: inside of your `App.js` file `import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - this is where we're going to declare and specify our router. 
* Step 6: create 3 `<Route />` setting their `path` prop equal to `/`, `/about`, `/contact` with their respective components.
  - be sure to incluce the `exact` prop on the root component for `/` to make sure that it's rendering the exact component and not all the other components. 
* Step 7: you should now be able to type `/`, `/about`, `/contact` after `localhost:PORT/` to see what's a

### Steps for setting up your Navigation

* Step 8: inside of `Navigation.js` `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'` 
* Step 9: delete `NavLink` and replace it with `<Link />`
  - Pro-tip: highlight NavLink and use `cmd/ctrl + d` to select them all at once.
* Step 10: change the href on `<Link>` to `to` and specify the correct routes to navigate to. 
* Step 11: head over to your app and start navigating. You should be able to see your URLS changing their paths as you go.
